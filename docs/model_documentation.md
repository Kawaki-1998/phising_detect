# Phishing Domain Detection - Model Documentation

## 1. Model Selection

### Chosen Model: LightGBM Classifier
- **Algorithm Type**: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees
- **Key Parameters**:
  - n_estimators: 200
  - learning_rate: 0.05
  - max_depth: 10
  - num_leaves: 31
  - min_child_samples: 20
  - class_weight: balanced
  - random_state: 42

### Rationale for Selection:
1. **Performance**: 
   - Training Accuracy: 96.95%
   - Test Accuracy: 96.32%
   - AUC Score: 0.994 (excellent discrimination)

2. **Advantages**:
   - Handles large datasets efficiently
   - Built-in support for categorical features
   - Fast training and prediction speed
   - Good handling of missing values
   - Built-in early stopping

## 2. Feature Engineering

### Basic URL Features:
1. **URL Components**:
   - Domain-level features
   - Directory-level features
   - File-level features
   - Parameter-level features

2. **Character Counts**:
   - Special characters (., -, _, /, ?, =, @, etc.)
   - Length-based features
   - Vowel counts

### Advanced Features:
1. **Brand Detection**:
   - Common brand name presence
   - Brand impersonation detection
   - Number-letter substitutions (e.g., 0 for o)
   - Suspicious keywords

2. **Security Indicators**:
   - TLD analysis
   - Domain age
   - SSL/TLS certificate status
   - DNS records

### Feature Preprocessing:
- MinMax scaling for numerical features
- Feature standardization
- Saved scaler for consistent predictions

## 3. Current Performance Analysis

### Strengths:
1. High accuracy on legitimate domains:
   - google.com (90.91% confidence)
   - facebook.com (90.80% confidence)
   - microsoft.com (89.52% confidence)
   - amazon.com (90.91% confidence)

2. Good detection of obvious phishing:
   - Domains with multiple suspicious indicators
   - Clearly malicious patterns

### Areas for Improvement:
1. False Negatives:
   - g00gle.com (misclassified as legitimate)
   - micros0ft-security.com (misclassified as legitimate)
   - paypal-secure.com (misclassified as legitimate)

2. Confidence Levels:
   - Some legitimate predictions have lower confidence
   - Need better discrimination for edge cases

## 4. Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Feature Enhancement**:
   - Implement Levenshtein distance for brand similarity
   - Add domain registration data features
   - Include SSL certificate validation
   - Add WHOIS data integration

2. **Model Optimization**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
   - Experiment with ensemble methods
   - Implement threshold optimization

### Development Roadmap:

1. **Short-term Goals** (1-2 weeks):
   - Implement real-time domain checking API
   - Add browser extension integration
   - Improve prediction speed
   - Add batch processing capability

2. **Medium-term Goals** (2-4 weeks):
   - Develop monitoring dashboard
   - Implement automated model retraining
   - Add user feedback mechanism
   - Create detailed reporting system

3. **Long-term Goals** (1-2 months):
   - Deploy as a cloud service
   - Implement distributed processing
   - Add multi-language support
   - Create API documentation

### Infrastructure Requirements:

1. **Development**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement automated testing
   - Create development environment

2. **Deployment**:
   - Configure production servers
   - Set up monitoring
   - Implement backup systems

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regular model updates
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security updates

## 5. Conclusion

The current model shows promising results with high accuracy and good generalization. However, there are clear areas for improvement, particularly in detecting sophisticated phishing attempts. The next steps focus on enhancing both the feature set and model performance while building out the infrastructure for production deployment.
