# High-Level Design Document: Phishing Domain Detection System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a high-level design overview of the Phishing Domain Detection System, a machine learning-based solution for identifying potentially malicious domains in real-time.

### 1.2 Scope
The system provides real-time domain analysis through a RESTful API, utilizing advanced feature engineering and machine learning to detect phishing attempts.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture with the following main components:
- FastAPI Web Service
- MLflow Model Registry
- Feature Extraction Service
- Model Training Pipeline
- Monitoring & Logging System

### 2.2 Data Flow
1. Client submits domain for analysis
2. Feature extraction service gathers domain characteristics
3. ML model processes features and generates prediction
4. Results are logged and returned to client

## 3. Components Design

### 3.1 Web Service Layer
- FastAPI framework for RESTful endpoints
- Asynchronous request handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and security measures

### 3.2 Feature Engineering Layer
- Domain structure analysis
